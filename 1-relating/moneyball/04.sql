-- You need to make a recommendation about which players the team should consider hiring. With the teamâ€™s dwindling budget, the general manager wants to know which players were paid the lowest salaries in 2001. In 4.sql, write a SQL query to find the 50 players paid the least in 2001.

SELECT 
    p."first_name", 
    p."last_name",
    s."salary"
FROM players as p
JOIN salaries as s
ON p."id" = s."player_id"
WHERE s."year" = 2001
ORDER BY 
    "salary" ASC, 
    "first_name" ASC, 
    "last_name" ASC, 
    "player_id" ASC
LIMIT 50;
